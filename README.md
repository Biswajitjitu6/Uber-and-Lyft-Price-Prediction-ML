# Uber-Lyft-cab-price-prediction
## Problem Description:
#### Uber and Lyft's ride prices are not constant like public transport. They are greatly affected by the demand and supply of rides at a given time So what exactly drives this demand? Our objective is to fix the current price prediction system with a predictive model that can estimate the price of a ride including a more widespread range of measures. We aim to better understand the combined effect of day, time, type of ride and weather conditions on the price of the ride.

## Data Description:
#### The dataset is the part of a Kaggle competition. The raw data consisted of information about cab rides for every 5 minutes and weather data for every hour from a few locations in Boston for a few weeks from November December 2018.

## Data Preprocessing:
#### The data were merged based on location and time and the resulting dataset comprised 6,90,107 instances 21 features

## Exaplanatory Data Analysis
####  -Univariate analysis 
####  -Outliers handling
####  -Bi-variate analysis
####  -One Hot encoding

## Feature Engineering
####  -Feature Selection
####  -Feature transformation

## Model Building
#### To solve this regression problem we used several machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression,Lasso Regression,Decision Tree,Random Forest,Ada Boost.For better performance of these algorithms and to achieve desired outputs we deployed some feature engineering and hyperparameter optimization techniques.

# From our indepth analysis for both Lyft and Uber data we can conclude that Random forest is the best method for our price prediction.
